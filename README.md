# FunK
FunK is a functional testing framework with multiplayer support for Unreal Engine 5

## TODO (not necessarily in order)
- Readme.md with setup, usage & concepts
- Input simulation
- Utilities to help test with lag, relevancy & other multiplayer pitfalls
- Gauntlet & CI
- Input recording, so that input can be manually played and then repeated as a test
- Performance Tests
- Comments
